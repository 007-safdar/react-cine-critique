 Issue for 8 days
 React app not rendering in production.
 So basically once npm build is done, it strips out reract dev server. App was working well in dev server but for prod we either need to config a server (nginx)
 or we need to use some hosting apps. Here we push the /build folder.
 After deleting node modules and build folder and doing npm update, single page is working
 Each page requires an index.html to work

 Now second issue is when we go to other pages index.html is not being routed correctly. This is wip 


 Changes to do on netlify: 
 Make sure all other url paths can re-direct to index.html. Create a netlify.toml file and add the below configs 

[[redirects]]
from ="/*"
to = "/index.html"
status = 200


In okta settings add the hostname in cors policy and in logout uri
